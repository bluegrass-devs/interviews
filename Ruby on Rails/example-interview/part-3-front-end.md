## Intro

There was a one-hour break between the second interview and this one.

There were two interviewers, both senior engineers. One was shadowing and mostly observed.

I was feeling nervous because this is the area where I feel least confident, so I tried to lighten the mood by being honest that I was nervous, and then sharing how my wife earlier had told me “Good luck with the Java questions”, and how I was glad that at least this wasn’t about Java. (It came across awkwardly. Oh well.)

They started by introducing themselves and asking me to introduce myself briefly.

They also said that candidates come in with varying levels of front-end knowledge, so they'd adjust expectations accordingly.

They asked what my front-end JS experience had been. I said two years of React, which I’d learned on the job.

## Question: What is a memorable front-end feature that you implemented?

I described one from my last job, and why it was memorable.

## Exercise: designing the front-end and API endpoints for a wall chart app

I won’t recount the exercise in detail, but here’s the gist. Imagine an app that contains categories for the various anatomical systems, and for each category there’s a view containing (a) a sidebar listing individual organs and (b) a chart (image) of the selected organ. Given this app, I was asked to explain what API endpoints would be needed, and the shape of the data passed into the view.

Later in the exercise, additional features were revealed related to adding annotations to an image.

A complication was also added: what if there are a huge number of items in a category and it takes too long to load them all at once?

There was no coding component of the exercise, and the only visuals were two images, one of a category view, and another of a category view with the annotation feature added.

## Conclusion

At the one-hour mark, they said they could stay a few minutes if I had any questions.

I asked (again) about a culture of learning, what’s their favorite thing about working at Doximity, and what does Doximity do to help people connect in a remote work environment.

My overall feeling: kinda bad, largely because I was nervous but also because some parts of the exercise were awkward to do over a call, such as describing URLs and UIs, when in real life these things are typically done async and in writing, often with visuals, or during actual pair programming. And the instructions in some parts of the exercise had extraneous and distracting elements, so it took me a minute each time to figure out what was actually being asked, which only made me more nervous.
