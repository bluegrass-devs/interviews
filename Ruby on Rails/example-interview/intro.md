# Ruby on Rails example interview: Introduction

The files in this directory are notes on an actual interview in November 2023 for a mid-level full-stack developer position at [Doximity](https://www.doximity.com), a large company that uses Ruby on Rails on the back end.

## Hiring process

Doximity’s hiring process is explained in [this article](https://engineering.doximity.com/articles/engineering-recruitment-process-doximity). It’s pretty standard.

The take-home assignment was to add several search-related features to a simple blog app built with Rails. It wasn’t difficult, and (besides Rails itself) required only basic familiarity with RSpec and SQL.

## How I took notes

I didn’t take notes during technical interviews, so as not to distract myself or the interviewer, except when the interviewer mentioned something that I wanted to learn more or follow up about afterward.

Immediately after each interview, I typed out rough notes of everything I could remember from the interview. In the following days, I polished up the notes, and that’s what you see in this directory.

## Interview topics

This list was sent to me about a week before the technical interviews.
